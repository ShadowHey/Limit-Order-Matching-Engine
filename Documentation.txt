What I am coding? There is an orderbook for a single stock and once the order is given for some quantity that is buy or sell , the order is executed and the orderbook is updated. Nothing fancy basic orderbook and order execution and return of important things to look at.

Order:
  id: who it is
  side (BUY / SELL)
  price
  quantity
  timestamp

PriceLevel:
  price
  queue of orders (FIFO)

OrderBook:
  bids (sorted descending)
  asks (sorted ascending)
